Communication Contract:

1. Communicate through discord.

2. 24 hour response time.

3. Be respectful.

4. Set up a mutual time to work on projects each week.

5. Let partner know if something comes up and you need to find a different time to work.

6. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

Send Data: This is achieved by entering data into the userinput field for the friends list. This field would take the friend or team members name, which is
then sent to an array that stores the names. NOTE: The input does not actually have to be a name, it will take any input at the moment.

Retrieve Data: This is achieved by a seperate window, as rabbitMQ does not allow you to send data and receive data at the same time. The data from the array is
retrieved and printed to the user upon request.
